    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi my dearest guest, how are you today?. I hope you're having a great day, even if this day seems horrible to you, i belive it would be better someday as long as you still hope and try to change the situation for the better (I believe in you). First let me introduce myself. My name is Richo Setiawan, you can call me Richo. I was born in Indonesia and still living in Indonesia until this day. I am a collage student, i took Information System Major on Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science at UKRIDA University. I think thats all about me and thank you.</p><br><br>
    <h3>This Project?</h3>
    <p>The reason as to why i made this project was to entertaining and cheer up many people, it would be a lie if that was the only reason, my second reason was to complete a Basic Web Programming class assignment at my college subject. If you were wondering why i named this website Mangata, thats because i like the meaning behind those word "road-like reflection of the moon on the water" i interpret it as "a hope in the darkness that leads someone". Also this is my very first project, so if you want to give suggestions and criticisms on this project, you can contact me at the contact provided, your opinion is very valuable to me and for the development of this project. Thank you.</p>
